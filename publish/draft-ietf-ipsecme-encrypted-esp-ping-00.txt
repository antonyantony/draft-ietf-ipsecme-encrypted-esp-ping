                      Encrypted ESP Echo Protocol
                draft-ietf-ipsecme-encrypted-esp-ping-00

Abstract


   This document defines the Encrypted ESP Echo Function, a mechanism
   designed to assess the reachability of IP Security (IPsec) network
   paths using Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) packets.  The
   primary objective is to reliably and efficiently detect the status of
   end-to-end paths by exchanging only encrypted ESP packets between
   IPsec peers.  The Encrypted Echo message can either use existing
   congestion control payloads from RFC9347 or a new message format
   defined here, with an option to specify a preferred return path when
   there is more than one pair of IPsec SAs between the same set of
   IPsec peers.

   A peer MAY announce the support using a new IKEv2 Status Notifcation
   ENCRYPTED_PING_SUPPORTED.

1.  Introduction

   In response to the operational need for a robust data-plane failure-
   detection mechanism for IP Security (IPsec) Encapsulating Security
   Payload (ESP) from [RFC4303], this document introduces Encrypted ESP
   Ping, including the Echo Request and Response.  This protocol offers
   a solution for assessing network path reachability dynamically and
   can optionally specify a return path for echo Reply messages.  The
   IPsec peer may announce its capability to support Encrypted ESP Ping
   using an IKEv2 Notification Status Type.

   This document covers only Encrypted ESP Ping, typically used after an
   IKE negotiation, while [I-D.colitti-ipsecme-esp-ping] specifies an
   unauthenticated ESP Ping to be used before IKE negotation.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC4301]:
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), Security Association (SA),
   Security Policy Database (SPD).

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC9347]: AGGFRAG
   tunnel.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC7110]: Return
   Path Specified LSP Ping

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Use cases

   Diagnosing operational problems in IPsec can be challenging.  The
   proposed Encrypted ESP Echo function aims to address some of these
   challenges by providing a reliable and efficient diagnostic protocol,
   enabling the development of effective tools; e.g.  Encrypted ESP
   Ping.

3.1.  ESP Blocked or Filtered

   An IPsec session typically employs ESP, using IP or IPv6 packets.
   ESP parameters are negotiated using IKEv2, with default IKEv2
   messages exchanged over UDP port 500.  In scenarios where ESP packets
   are not encapsulated in UDP (i.e., using the ESP protocol),
   successful IKE negotiation may occur, but ESP packets might fail to
   reach the peer due to differences in the packet path or filtering
   policies compared to IKE packets (e.g., UDP is allowed while ESP is
   filtered, typically due to misconfiguration).  Additionally, when
   using UDP encapsulation, ESP packets may encounter different
   filtering policies.  This is typically due to broken packet
   filtering.  Although this is less likely, it is still possible and
   can be difficult to diagnose.  Operational experience suggests that
   networks and some home routers that drop ESP packets are common
   enough to cause problems for general- purpose VPN applications that
   require reliable performance on the Internet.  Encrypted ESP Ping
   would greatly assist in diagnosing these scenarios.

3.2.  Probing Multiple Paths

   When there are multiple paths created using multiple Child SAs with
   identical Traffic Selectors as specified in [RFC7296]or more
   explicitly in [RFC9611], there is a need to probe each Child SA,
   including the network path, independently from an IPsec peer.  Each
   SA may traverse different network paths and may have different
   policies.  The Encrypted ESP Ping would specifically help determine
   the reachability of each path independently.

3.3.  Probe Return Path

   IPsec Security Associations (SAs) are negotiated as a pair,
   consisting of two unidirectional SAs in one exchange.  IKEv2
   [RFC7296] Section 2.9 allows installing multiple Child SAs with
   identical Traffic Selectors.  When there are multiple paths, the
   Encrypted ESP Ping should support requesting an echo response via a
   specific return path IPsec SA.  To request a return path, additional
   attributes are necessary.  The initiator would propose a specific SPI
   as the preferred return path.  A specific return path SPI is
   necessary when to probe a specific path among multiple possible SAs
   between same peer.  Multiple paths can exist for various reasons,
   either [RFC9611] or a primary and secondary path scenario.  For
   example over a satellite link and over fiber, the receiving peer may
   have a policy to respond via the fiber path even when the request
   arrives via the satellite link.  If the initiator requests a return
   path, the responder SHOULD try to respond via that path, IPsec SA.
   However, the final decision is up to the responder.  If the responder
   decides to send the response via a different path than the requested
   return path, the initiator SHOULD notice it and notify the initiator
   application.  An example is Return Path Specified LSP ping specified
   in [RFC7110].

3.4.  Manually Probing a Constant Rate on the AGGFRAG Tunnel

   In IPsec setups, maintaining a constant traffic rate can help in
   disguising actual traffic patterns, providing enhanced security.  The
   AGGFRAG tunnel enables constant rate probing to ensure consistent
   bandwidth usage, helping to mitigate the risk of traffic analysis by
   adversaries.  This approach is particularly useful to discover
   possible bandwidth where maintaining a uniform traffic pattern is
   critical for security, using IP-TFS.

3.5.  Why Not Use Existing IP Tools

   Existing tools such as ICMP ping or traceroute assume IP
   connectivity.  However, in IPsec gateway setups, the gateway itself
   may not have an IP address that matches the IPsec Security Policy
   Database (SPD).  A peer MUST accept Encrypted ESP Ping messages even
   when it does not math a local SPD.

   Additionally, in the case of multiple SAs as mentioned above, IP
   tools would find it hard, if not impossible, to generate IP traffic
   to explore multiple paths specifically

3.6.  Also Track Incoming Traffic for liveness check

   In addition to probing the outgoing paths, it is essential to monitor
   and account for the incoming traffic to ensure comprehensive network
   visibility of IPsec.  Incoming SA traffic counters are unique to
   IPsec compared to other tunneling or native IP connections.  In
   IPsec, the incoming counters reliably indicate a viable path.  This
   should be taken into account when probing IPsec paths.  For example,
   when the crypto subsystem is overloaded, the responder may miss out
   on Encrypted ESP Ping responses.  However, tracking the incoming
   traffic after the ping probe is sent would help applications to
   recognize the IPsec path is still viable.

4.  Protocol Specification

   In a typical use case, after completing an IPsec SA negotiation,
   [RFC7296], an IPsec peer wishing to verify the viability of the
   current network path for ESP packets MAY initiate an ESP Echo
   Request.  The ESP Echo Request packet must be encrypted.  If the SPIs
   are negotiated it SHOULD utilize an SPI value previously negotiated,
   e.g. negotiated through IKEv2.

   The initiator sets the ESP Next Header value to AGGFRAG_PAYLOAD which
   has the value 144, as specified in [RFC9347].  This can be followed
   by different echo request sub-type payloads with a well defined
   format and optional empty data blocks following it.

   The receiving IPsec peer, having established ESP through IKE, MAY
   respond to an ESP Echo Response.  When replying to an encrypted ESP
   Echo Request, the ESP Echo Response MUST be encrypted and utilize the
   corresponding SPI.  The responder also sets the ESP Next Header value
   to AGGFRAG_PAYLOAD: 144, followed by the requested sub-type

   AGGFRAG_PAYLOAD Payload starts from ESP Next Header value: 144 and
   followed one of the two Request payloads specified.

4.1.  Using Congestion Control Payload

   IP-TFS Congestion Control AGGFRAG_PAYLOAD Payload Format as specified
   in [RFC9347] Section 6.1.2 can be used for Echo Request and response.
   When using this payload for Echo Request and response, IPv4 or IPv6
   Data Block MUST NOT be concatenated, especially when USE_AGGFRAG is
   not successfully negotiated.  This this request does not support
   requesting a specific return path.

   [AA when using USE_AGGFRAG tunnel is negotiated, responder may
   concatenate AGGFRAG_PAYLOAD Congestion control probe]

   The Echo request and response payloads are not subject to IPsec
   Security Policy(SP), typically negotiated using IKEv2 a nd manually
   configured.  End padding padding would be necessary of the the tunnel
   is always sending fixed size ESP payload or possibly detect path
   anomalies.

   When probing do not take the lack of a response alone as an
   indication of the unreachability of the return path using ESP echo;
   also consider the received bytes on the return path.  IPsec has a
   unique advantage over other tunneling protocols when the return path
   shows incoming bytes, indicating that the path is partially
   functional.  This is especially useful when used as a liveness check
   on busy paths.  When there is no response, instead of concluding that
   the path is not viable and taking action, such as tearing down the
   IPsec connection, read the incoming bytes.  This would help avoid
   tearing down busy paths due to the missing ESP echo response.

   *  Return path: 1 bit flag, set when requesting a specific return
      path

   *  Data Length : number of data octets following, length 16 bits

   *  Identifier : A 16-bit request identifier.  The identifier SHOULD
      be set to a unique value to distinguish between different ESP
      Request sessions.  Response copy it from the request

   *  Sequence number: A 16-bit field that increments with each echo
      request sent.

   *  Return path: 32 bits, optional requested return path SPI, when R
      is set.

   *  Data : Optional data that follows the Echo request.

   The responder SHOULD copy the request message and MUST change the
   Sub-type to ESP-ECHO-RESPONSE.

4.3.  Return Path Validation

   On the initiator, the return path SPI in the request MUST be in the
   local SADB with the same peer as the destination.  The responder
   should also validate the requested return path SPI.  When the SPI
   does not match the initiator in the SPD, the responder MUST NOT
   respond via the requested SPI.  This is specifically to avoid
   amplification or DDoS.  However,the responder MAY respond to the peer
   using its default Security Parameter Index (SPI).

5.  IKEv2 Notification

   The peer MAY announce support for Encrypted ESP Ping functionality
   using the Notification Status Type `ENCRYPTED_PING_SUPPORTED` during
   the IKEv2 negotiation, in the IKE_AUTH exchange.  This announcement
   allows the initiator to determine if the peer supports Encrypted ESP
   Ping, enabling a reliable expectation of responses.

   By advertising this support, peers enhance their ability to perform
   dynamic path reachability assessments for diagnostic purposes.
   However, this does not guarantee a response to every request a peer
   receives.  Responding to each request remains a local policy
   decision, depending on the resources available at the time.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates [RFC9347] to allow ESP Echo Request and ESP
   Echo Response without a successful negotiation of USE_AGGFRAG.

7.  Operational Considerations

   When an explicit return path is requested and the ESP Echo responder
   SHOULD make best effort to respond via this path, however, if local
   policies do not allow this respond via another SA.

   A typical implementation involves creating an ESP Echo socket, which
   allows setting an outgoing SPI during initialization,and matching
   source and destination address.  Once socket is setup before sending
   any data, only write payload with optionally specifying return path.

8.  Acknowledgments

   ACKs TBD

9.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations are similar to other unconnected request-
   reply protocols such as ICMP or ICMPv6 echo.  The proposed ESP echo
   and response does not constitute an amplification attack because the
   ESP Echo Reply is almost same size as the ESP Echo Request.
   Furthermore, this can be rate limited or filtered using ingress
   filtering per BCP 38 [RFC2827]
